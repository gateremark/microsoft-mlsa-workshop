# Creating your website

Now that you have your basic resume crafted in [HTML](./create-html.md) and [CSS](./add-style.md), let's work on putting your resume on a website. To do this, we'll use a feature called GitHub Pages, which allows you to create a website directly from a repository on GitHub. 

## Commit your changes

The first thing we need to do is commit the changes we've made to our **resume** repository to GitHub. This will upload all of the resume content that we added to our repository, so we can use it for our website.

1. Select the **Source Control** icon on the left-hand side Activity Bar. There should be a small blue circle with a number inside, indicating the number of files you've made changes to since the last time you committed your code. 
1. Hover over the word **Changes**, and select the **+** button to Stage All Changes. All of the changes you stage will be committed. 
1. Write a message to go along with your commit. Something like "Add resume content" works great. 
1. Select the check mark icon at the top of the Source Control pane. This will commit your changes to your repository. 

## Set up GitHub Pages

Next, we'll need to turn on GitHub Pages for our **resume** repository.
1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.com, and select **Settings**, next to the gear icon. 
1. Select **Pages** in the left-hand menu. 
1. Under **Source** select the **main** branch of your repository to be the source for your new website. Then, select **Save**.

1. After you select your source, you'll be notified of the address of your new website. It should look something like *your-username.github.io/resume/*. Navigate to the page, and check out your live resume website!
