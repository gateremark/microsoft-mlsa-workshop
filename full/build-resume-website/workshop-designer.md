## Build a Website to Showcase your Resume

## Stage 1: Desired Results 

By the end of this workshop, you will have built your resume in semantic HTML, styled it using CSS including CSS Grid, and launched it as a web site on GitHub pages. You'll explore building this all using GitHub.dev, an online code editor based on Visual Studio Code.

## Stage 2: Evidence

You will be able to show your skills by building a resume of your own and launching it online. You can extend your knowledge by adding styles, more HTML, and even making the resume responsive so it will display well on various sizes of screens.
 
## Stage 3: Learning Plan

- Get setup to build the site using GitHub and GitHub.dev
- Create the HTML scaffold of the site
- Add content and style the site using CSS
- Launch the site using GitHub pages
