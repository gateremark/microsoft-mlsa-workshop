## Workshop Source
[Introduction to regression models by using R and tidymodels](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-regression-models/?WT.mc_id=academic-59300-cacaste)

## Stage 1: Desired Results 

1. Students will be skilled at:
- Understanding what is regression and when to use a regression model
- Training and evaluating regression models using the Tidymodels framework
1. Students will be able to independently use their learning to:
- Experimenting with different regression models 
- Tuning models hyperparameters

## Stage 2: Evidence
 
- Hands-on challenge on real estate dataset, following [Challenge-regression.ipynb](./solution/Challenge-regression.ipynb) notebook
- Knowledge check quiz 

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

- Introduction
- Train and evaluate a regression model
- Experimenting with models
- Challenge - Create a regression model using Tidymodels
- Knowledge check
