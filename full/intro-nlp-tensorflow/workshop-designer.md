# Generate text with TensorFlow and Keras

## Workshop Source

[Introduction to NLP with TensorFlow](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/intro-natural-language-processing-tensorflow/?WT.mc_id=academic-56322-alfredodeza)

## Stage 1: Desired Results

Attendees will learn how to process text so that they can generate text from it using TensorFlow and Keras running in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Stage 2: Evidence

At the end of the workshop, students will be able to work with a dataset to generate text. A short quiz (knowledge check) is linked in the resources of this workshop and available in the slides.

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

- Set up your environment (if working locally)
- Process text to represent them as tensors
- Represent words with embeddings
- Use RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) to capture patterns
- Generate text with RNNs
