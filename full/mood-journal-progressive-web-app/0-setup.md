# Set up your environment

First things first, let's get your development environment ready. You will be installing the tools needed to build the Progressive Web App. And you will create a repository to keep track our coding progress.

## Install tools

Make sure you go to the following resources to install the tools you need:
- [Microsoft Edge](https://aka.ms/learn-pwa/workshop/edge)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://aka.ms/learn-pwa/workshop/vscode)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Azure account](https://aka.ms/learn-pwa/workshop/azure.microsoft.com/free/students/)

## Create a repository

1. If you don't have a GitHub account, go ahead and [join GitHub](https://aka.ms/learn-pwa/workshop/github.com/join). Then, [create a new public repository](https://aka.ms/learn-pwa/workshop/github.com/new) named **repose**. If you've never made a GitHub repository before, check out the [documentation](https://aka.ms/learn-pwa/workshop/docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) for more information. Make sure to select **Public** and to initialize the repository **without** a **README**.
1. You will push the directory created in the next step to this repository.

## Next steps

Awesome! You have the tools you need to begin creating your Progressive Web App. Now, let's get to work. üëâüèº Head to [1-create-pwa](1-create-pwa.md) to get started.
