# Introduction to clustering models by using R and Tidymodels 

## Workshop Source
[Introduction to clustering models by using R and tidymodels](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-clustering-models/?WT.mc_id=academic-59300-cacaste)

## Stage 1: Desired Results 

1. Students will be skilled at:
- Understanding what is clustering and when to use a clustering model
- Training and evaluating clustering models in R
1. Students will be able to independently use their learning to:
- Use Principal Componenent Analysis (PCA) to create a 2D version of the features for visualization
- Experimenting with different clustering models (k-means, hierarchical clustering)

## Stage 2: Evidence
 
- Hands-on challenge to separate a dataset consisting of three numeric features (A, B, and C) into clusters, following [Challenge-Clustering.ipynb](./solution/Challenge-Clustering.ipynb) notebook
- Knowledge check quiz 

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

- Introduction
- Evaluate different type of clustering
- Challenge - Build a clustering model in R
- Knowledge check
