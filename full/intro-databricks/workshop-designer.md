## Stage 1: Desired Results

Attendees will learn how to read and write data to an Azure Databricks cluster using notebooks and ready-to-use datasets.

## Stage 2: Evidence

At the end of the workshop, students will be able to work with datasets and different data formats like JSON, Parquet, and CSV, to write and read from an Azure Databricks cluster. A short quiz (knowledge check) is linked in the resources of this workshop.

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

- Login into your Azure account
- Create an Azure Databricks cluster
