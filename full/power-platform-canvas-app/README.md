## Workshop flow

### Setup your environment

Ensuring that you have an M365 subscription, visit [Power Apps studio](https://make.powerapps.com?WT.mc_id=academic-56577-hmitra) and sign in with your account. 

If not, [configure and setup an environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-environment?WT.mc_id=academic-56577-hmitra).

### Create the app

After setting up the environment and opening [Power Apps studio](https://make.powerapps.com?WT.mc_id=academic-56577-hmitra), click 'Create' from the left panel.

### Choosing data

You can use some sample data in the attached [zip file](./data/Contoso-Site-Tracking.zip). Extract and upload the zip file using One Drive, choosing `One Drive for business` as a data source.

### Exploring the various elements

To add more detail to the app, explore the various [elements](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/build-app-solution/2-learn-basic-elements?WT.mc_id=academic-56577-hmitra) and services.

### Add logic

Add logic to the app using [functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/build-app-solution/4-get-started-functions-power-apps?WT.mc_id=academic-56577-hmitra).

### Share your app

Now it's time to share! You can publish your app to the organization using [Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/build-app-solution/5-share-app?WT.mc_id=academic-56577-hmitra).
