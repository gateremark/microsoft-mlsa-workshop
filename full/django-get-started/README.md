    - Inheritance
    - Package management
    - Virtual environments
- Software
  - [Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/python-install-vscode/?WT.mc_id=academic-56601-chrhar)

## What students will learn

Are you looking for a web framework which can streamline project creation? Are you looking to quickly create a website which uses a database as a back-end? Django is the perfect tool for the job! You will learn the core concepts of Django, how to install the framework and create your first project, and configure routing and views.

## Workshop flow

### Setup your environment

Attendees will start by [configuring their environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/django-get-started/3-exercise-install-django?WT.mc_id=academic-56601-chrhar). They will install the necessary tooling, create the folder for their project, and setup the necessary Python libraries.

### Create the project and app

After setting up the environment, attendees will [create the project and app](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/django-get-started/5-exercise-first-project?WT.mc_id=academic-56601-chrhar). Projects serve as the container for apps and global settings, while apps contain the code for to respond to user requests.

### Configure routes and first view

Once the project is up and running, the attendees will [create their first route and view](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/django-get-started/7-exercise-create-paths-views?WT.mc_id=academic-56601-chrhar). They'll launch the site and see Hello World displayed!

## Next steps

- [Create data-driven websites by using the Python framework Django](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/django-create-data-driven-websites/?WT.mc_id=academic-56601-chrhar)

## Practice

With your first project created you can begin to further explore Django. You can see how to [create models](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/django-models-data/?WT.mc_id=academic-56601-chrhar), [modify data with the admin site](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/django-admin-site/?WT.mc_id=academic-56601-chrhar), and [use views and templates to display data](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/django-views-templates/?WT.mc_id=academic-56601-chrhar).
