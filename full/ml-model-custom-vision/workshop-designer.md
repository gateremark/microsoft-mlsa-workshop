## Build a Machine Learning Model

## Stage 1: Desired Results 

1. Students will be skilled at using the Custom Vision AI service to train an image model for classification, and use Python to test these classifications

1. Students will be able to independently use their learning to build a new model using their own images

## Stage 2: Evidence
 
Student are offered a challenge at the end of the last module to show transfer knowledge

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

- Install and configure tools
- Train your model
- Classify images using your model
