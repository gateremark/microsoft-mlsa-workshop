## Create a Regression Model with Azure Machine Learning designer

## Stage 1: Desired Results 

This workshop explores the use of [Azure Machine Learning Designer](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning/designer/?WT.mc_id=academic-56424-dmitryso) to train, evaluate and deploy a regression model. 

1. Students will be skilled at:
   - Using low code / no code Azure ML designer tool to train a regression model based on existing dataset
   - Evaluate the quality of the model
   - Create an inference pipeline and deploy it as a REST endpoint

1. Students will be able to independently use their learning to train regression models on different datasets and deploy the models as Web APIs.

## Stage 2: Evidence

As a result of the workshop, students will train a machine learning model to predict car prices based on a number of parameters. They will also deploy the model as REST service and consume this service from a snippet of Python code. At the end, as an optional exercise, students can apply this knowledge to their own dataset, such as Instagram Likes dataset, or regression datasets from Kaggle.

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

Workshop milestones:

1. Create Machine Learning Workspace and Compute Resources
1. Create the Experiment, Explore and Clean Data
1. Train the model and evaluate results
1. Build and Deploy Inference Pipeline
1. Test the Model
1. [Optional]: Try to train different model
1. Clean Up
